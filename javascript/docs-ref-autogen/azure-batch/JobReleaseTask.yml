    summary: "A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node\rwhere the job has run.\r\rThe Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the\rfollowing: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while\rthe job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time constraint is\rreached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job Manager task\rcompleted, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager\rcompletes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of the\rjob have run and the Job Preparation task ran and completed. If you reimage\ra compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends\rwithout any further tasks of the job running on that compute node (and hence\rthe Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does\rnot run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task\ris still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node\rstarts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks\rhave completed. The Job Release task runs in the background. It does not\roccupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the\rmaxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool."
