For more information\rabout updating role instances, see Update an Azure Service at\rhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh472157.aspx. This\roperation is an asynchronous operation. To determine whether the\rManagement service has finished processing the request, call Get\rOperation Status. For more information on asynchronous operations, see\rTracking Asynchronous Service Management Requests at\rhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460791.aspx. Prior\rto calling the Walk Upgrade Domain operation you must have called Upgrade\rDeployment, Change Deployment Configuration, or Rollback Update Or\rUpgrade. By default, a service is deployed with five update domains,\rwhich are updated one at a time during an in-place update. For\rinformation on modifying the number of update domains in the service\rdefinition file, see the Azure Service Definition Schema (.csdef File).\rTo perform a manual update of your deployment, proceed in this order:\rCall Upgrade Deployment with the Mode element set to manual. Call Walk\rUpgrade Domain to update each domain within the deployment. Update\rdomains must be updated in order. For example, begin with domain 0,\rproceed to domain 1, and so on. Important: An update that adds or removes\rrole instances will result in a configuration update to all roles that\rare deployed in the cloud service. Existing role instances need to be\rnotified of new role instances so that all role instances can communicate\rtogether in the cloud service. While an update is in progress, call Get\rDeployment to determine its status. If the update is in progress, Get\rDeployment returns an UpgradeStatus element that contains information\rabout the update. If the update is complete, or if no update is in\rprogress, then the UpgradeStatus element is null.  (see\rhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460800.aspx for\rmore information)"
