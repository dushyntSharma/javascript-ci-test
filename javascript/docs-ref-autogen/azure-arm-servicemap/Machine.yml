    summary: "A machine resource represents a discovered computer system. It can be\r*monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on it, or *discovered*,\ri.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored\rmachines. As machines change, prior versions of the machine resource are\rpreserved and available for access. A machine is live during an interval of\rtime, if either its Dependency Agent has reported data during (parts) of\rthat interval, or a Dependency agent running on other machines has reported\ractivity associated with the machine."
